<h1>About</h1>

<p>Hi, I'm David Kerkeslager. I'm a software engineer based in Brooklyn, New York.</p>
<p>I play guitar and rock climb in my spare time.</p>

<p>My public key is <a href='/public-key.txt'>here</a>, but you should verify the key fingerprint with me or someone you trust knows it's mine before using that for anything.</p>
